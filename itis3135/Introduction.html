                Personal background: Hi! A fun fact is that I was actually born in India! I came to America 
                when I was two year old and have moved to different states before me and my family came to North 
                Carolina in 2014. I am currently a computer science major with a concentration in cyber security 
                planning to graduate in December of 2022.

                future.

                Funny Story: Recently, me and my sister went on a quick Target run. We got out of the car and started walking to 
                the store when a huge red truck started it's engine right when we were walking past it and scared the living soul 
                from my sister. What made it even funnier is how the man behind the wheel started laughing too!
