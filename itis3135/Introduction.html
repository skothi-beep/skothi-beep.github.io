            Funny Story: All my funny stories revolve around my younger sister. Recently, we went on a quick 
            Target run. We got out of the car and started walking to the store when a huge red truck started
            it's engine right when we were walking past it and scared the living soul from my sister. Even funnier
            is how the man behind the wheel started laughing too.
