<h2>What are constellations?</h2>
    <p1> Constellations are essentially a group of stars that make various shapes in the night sky. They can be interpreted in different 
        ways based on the person looking at it. In simple terms it is like a game connecting the dots. A fun fact is that there are 
        88 official constellations. Additionally, during ancient times these constellations were used to track the calender.
