        <h3>Garoa Skincare</h3>
    </a>
        <p>
            Garoa is a beauty brand for skincare. They sell products for all skin types and with natural ingredients as well. Overall
            this website is visually appealing and uniquely utilizes various CSS visual design to draw the customer into their products.  
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Contrast: Throughout the website, there are definitely striking differences between the elements, whether that be the tone
                or the texture of the colors which makes the information on the site easy to read visually appealing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Repetition: The website uses the same set of nude colors throughout differnet sections of their website and the same applied
                visual design in order to make the website more appealing. They also use the same animation properities and bounciness bring 
                a sense of uniformity and Professionalism to the work.
            </li>
            <li>
                Alignment: The formation of the pictures and discriptions used are visually aligned in a straight manner, making the website 
                easier to read and understand along with images to create a sense of visual connection.
            </li>
            <li>
                Proximity: Each image and descirption is organized in a zig zag manner with enough space to distinguish the description for each
                design element. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    <a href="https://www.pennyjuice.com/">
        <h3>Penny Juice</h3>
    </a>
        <p>
            The Penny Juice website simply looks visually unappealing because and is a good example of all the elements that make up CRAP. 
            This site is to advertise various juices to childcare centers along with other information on how to contact and order the juices.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Contrast: The page itself has no contrast in the colors they use. There is no use of light or dark colors to make the text readable
                nor is there any variety in the tone of bright colors used as well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Repetition: There is some repetition in the website but does not seem clean in the sense that the headings are differnet and we cannot
                distinguish between which pieces of information is important and which is not.
            </li>
            <li>
                Alignment: The positioning of various navigation buttions are not aligned, although the content on the whole page seems to fit there is 
                no flow of clear intuitive navigation. The navigation bar seems to be overlapping the other content while scrolling as well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Proximity: The desgin of the website is not attractive, therefore even if there is some space found between each piece of information,
                the overall communication of the information lacks the content that is shared through it.
            </li>
        </ul>
